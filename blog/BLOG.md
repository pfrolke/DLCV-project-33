## Introduction

The world of fashion is diverse and large and thus encompasses a variety of styles to suit the taste and preferences of each individual. Fashion designers often create multiple styles or variations of their clothing to cater to the different tastes and preferences of their target audience. Examples of styles include the fabric type, the color, and the fit of a piece of clothing. However, the traditional process of designing and physically prototyping these new styles is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, which leads to a wasteful process. To alleviate these issues deep learning algorithms called style transfer algorithms are utilized.
